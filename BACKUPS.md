## Backup Procedures

### Automated Backup Script

The backup process is automated using the `backup.py` script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Automated backup script for helpdesk
# Runs daily via cron job

# Database backup
pg_dump -h localhost -U helpdesk helpdesk > backups/helpdesk_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# File backup
tar -czf backups/attachments_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz uploads/

# Upload to S3
aws s3 cp backups/ s3://helpdesk-backups/ --recursive

# Clean up old backups
find backups/ -name "*.sql" -mtime +30 -delete
find backups/ -name "*.tar.gz" -mtime +30 -delete
```

### Manual Backup Procedures

#### Database Backup
```bash
# Full database backup
pg_dump -h localhost -U helpdesk helpdesk > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Schema-only backup
pg_dump -h localhost -U helpdesk --schema-only helpdesk > schema_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Data-only backup
pg_dump -h localhost -U helpdesk --data-only helpdesk > data_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

#### File Backup
```bash
# Backup attachments
tar -czf attachments_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz uploads/

# Backup configuration
tar -czf config_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz server/.env* nginx/

# Backup logs
tar -czf logs_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz /var/log/helpdesk/
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

#### Full Database Recovery
```bash

# Restore database
psql -h localhost -U helpdesk helpdesk < backup_20240101_020000.sql

# Start application
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml start api
```

#### Point-in-Time Recovery
```bash
# Stop application
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop api

# Restore to specific point in time
pg_restore -h localhost -U helpdesk -d helpdesk --clean --if-exists backup_20240101_020000.sql

# Start application
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml start api
```

#### Schema Recovery
```bash
# Restore schema only
psql -h localhost -U helpdesk helpdesk < schema_20240101_020000.sql

# Restore data only
psql -h localhost -U helpdesk helpdesk < data_20240101_020000.sql
```

### File Recovery

#### Attachment Recovery
```bash
# Stop application
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml stop api

# Restore attachments
tar -xzf attachments_20240101_030000.tar.gz

# Start application
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml start api
```

#### Configuration Recovery
```bash
# Restore configuration
tar -xzf config_20240101_030000.tar.gz

# Restart services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart
```
