# Helpdesk Release Management Documentation

**Created by: Static Research Labs LLC**

## Release Overview

The helpdesk application follows a structured release management process to ensure reliable, secure, and efficient deployments. This document outlines the release procedures, versioning strategy, and deployment processes.

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

The application follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer) with the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or major feature additions
- **MINOR**: New features or significant improvements
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and minor improvements

### Version Examples
- `v1.0.0`: Initial production release
- `v1.1.0`: New feature release
- `v1.1.1`: Bug fix release
- `v2.0.0`: Major version with breaking changes

### Release Types

#### Production Releases
- **Stable**: Production-ready releases with full testing
- **LTS**: Long-term support releases for enterprise customers
- **Security**: Security-focused releases with critical fixes

#### Pre-Release Types
- **Alpha**: Early development releases for internal testing
- **Beta**: Feature-complete releases for user testing
- **Release Candidate (RC)**: Release candidates for final validation

- **Performance Degradation**: Automatic rollback on performance issues

#### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
./scripts/rollback.sh previous

# Validate rollback
./scripts/validate.sh https://api.yourdomain.com https://yourdomain.com

# Monitor system stability
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f api
```
