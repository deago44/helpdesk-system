# Helpdesk Security Documentation

**Created by: Static Research Labs LLC**

## Security Overview

The helpdesk application implements multiple layers of security to protect against common web application vulnerabilities and ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Security Controls

### Authentication & Authorization

#### User Authentication
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters, hashed using Werkzeug's secure password hashing
- **Session Management**: Secure session cookies with HTTPONLY, SECURE, and SAMESITE flags
- **Session Timeout**: 30-minute idle timeout with automatic session invalidation
- **Account Lockout**: Rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute force attacks

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Admin Role**: Full system access, user management, audit logs
- **Tech Role**: Ticket management, user assignment, limited admin functions
- **User Role**: Create and manage own tickets, view assigned tickets

#### Password Reset
- **Secure Tokens**: Cryptographically secure tokens with 1-hour expiry
- **Single Use**: Tokens are invalidated after use
- **Email Verification**: Password reset requires email verification
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 3 password reset requests per hour per user

### Network Security

#### TLS/SSL
- **HTTPS Only**: All traffic encrypted with TLS 1.2+
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security with preload
- **Certificate Management**: Automated certificate renewal with Let's Encrypt

#### CORS Configuration
- **Origin Validation**: Strict CORS policy allowing only authorized domains
- **Credential Handling**: Secure credential handling with SameSite cookies
- **Preflight Requests**: Proper handling of CORS preflight requests

#### Rate Limiting
- **API Endpoints**: 10 requests per second per IP
- **Login Endpoints**: 5 requests per minute per IP
- **Password Reset**: 2 requests per minute per IP
- **Distributed Limiting**: Redis-backed rate limiting for scalability

### Application Security

#### Input Validation
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens on all state-changing operations
- **File Upload Security**: File type validation and secure storage

#### Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Restrictive CSP to prevent XSS
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY to prevent clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff to prevent MIME sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enable browser XSS protection

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: Database encryption and S3 server-side encryption
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS for all communications
- **PII Protection**: Minimal data collection and secure storage
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all actions

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats

#### 1. Authentication Bypass
- **Threat**: Unauthorized access to user accounts
- **Mitigation**: Strong password policies, rate limiting, secure session management
- **Monitoring**: Failed login attempts, unusual access patterns

#### 2. SQL Injection
- **Threat**: Database compromise through malicious SQL
- **Mitigation**: Parameterized queries, input validation, ORM usage
- **Monitoring**: Database query monitoring, error logging

#### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Threat**: Malicious script execution in user browsers
- **Mitigation**: Input sanitization, output encoding, CSP headers
- **Monitoring**: XSS attempt detection, content filtering

#### 4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Threat**: Unauthorized actions on behalf of users
- **Mitigation**: CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, origin validation
- **Monitoring**: Unusual request patterns, token validation failures

#### 5. File Upload Attacks
- **Threat**: Malicious file uploads leading to system compromise
- **Mitigation**: File type validation, secure storage, virus scanning
- **Monitoring**: File upload monitoring, storage access logs

#### 6. Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Threat**: System unavailability through resource exhaustion
- **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, resource monitoring, auto-scaling
- **Monitoring**: Traffic patterns, resource usage, error rates

### Security Monitoring

#### Log Analysis
- **Authentication Events**: Login attempts, password changes, session management
- **Authorization Events**: Role changes, permission modifications
- **Data Access**: Database queries, file access, API calls
- **Security Events**: Failed validations, blocked requests, suspicious activity

#### Alerting
- **Failed Login Attempts**: Alert on multiple failed logins
- **Privilege Escalation**: Alert on role changes and permission modifications
- **Unusual Access Patterns**: Alert on abnormal user behavior
- **Security Violations**: Alert on blocked requests and security policy violations
